# Import Folder Images

## Executive summary

With the development of the datastore for Nachet, new opportunities arise. One
of them is to build a functionality to allow our thrust users to perform a batch
import of images into the database. With the introduction of this new feature,
users can now import an entire image folder at once, drastically reducing the
time and effort required.

Previously, users had to manually upload images into the blob storage, which was
a time-consuming process, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.
With the introduction of this feature, users will be able to import images for
AI training with Nachet directly, which simplifies the image import process but
also enhances the systemâ€™s overall efficiency and usability.

## Prerequisites

- The backend need to have a connection with the datastore

### API Route

#### /get-user-id

The `get-user-id` route retrieve the user-id for a given email.

#### /seeds

The `seeds` is the route to call to get the all the seeds names needed for
the frontend to build the form to upload the pictures to the database.

#### /batch-import

The `/batch-import` route is the endpoint that the frontend call to start a batch import.
It need save the number of pictures of the import and it return the picture_set_id as a session id

#### /upload-picture

The `/upload-pictures` route is the API endpoint responsible to assure the transit
of the picture to the database. The frontend might send the session id so the picture is associate to the right picture_set
