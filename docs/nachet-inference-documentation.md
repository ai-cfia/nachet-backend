# Inference Request with n-models pipelines

## Executive summary

Nachet Interactive is currently working on improving the effectiveness and user
experience of detecting regulated seeds. To achieve this goal, the AI Lab is
implementing various AI models that can perform tasks such as seed detection in
an image or seed classification. These models can work together or independently
to enhance the accuracy of the results. When combined with other models, each
model builds upon the work of the previous one to deliver the final outcome.
This process is defined as a pipeline of models.

Each model produces a result based on its inference, which is the process of
machine learning to generate predictions from a dataset. The purpose of this
document is to provide a technical design for the implementation of the
inference request with multiple pipelines where the pipeline to run against is
selected by a parameter.

## Glossary

### Pipelines
Pipelines are defined as a set of models that follow each other, where the output of
one model is used as input for the next models, and so on. A pipeline contains from 1 to n
models.

    B(model 01)-->|"model output
    send to the next one"|C(model 02)-->|can have n models|D(n models)

end
```

### Models
A model is an AI model that is a part of a pipeline. A model accepts images as
input and returns JSON as output. Generally, this JSON contains the coordinates
of objects in the source image, that the model may pass along to feed the next
step of the pipeline.


### Model from Frontend
On the frontend interface, a pipeline will be called a model, because the user
will not be aware of the difference. From the user's perspective, they send data
to a model and receive the result.

*Suggestion: we could call the pipeline a method if we don't want to mix terms.*
