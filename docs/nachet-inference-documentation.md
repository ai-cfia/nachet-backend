# Inference Request with n-models pipelines

## Executive summary

Nachet Interactive is currently working on improving the effectiveness and user
experience of detecting regulated seeds. To achieve this goal, the AI Lab is
implementing various AI models that can perform tasks such as seed detection in
an image or seed classification. These models can work together or independently
to enhance the accuracy of the results. When combined with other models, each
model builds upon the work of the previous one to deliver the final outcome.
This process is defined as a pipeline of models.

Each model produces a result based on its inference, which is the process of
machine learning to generate predictions from a dataset. The purpose of this
document is to provide a technical design for the implementation of the
inference request with multiple pipelines where the pipeline to run against is
selected by a parameter.

## Glossary

### Pipelines
Pipelines are defined as a set of models that follow each other, where the output of
one model is used as input for the next models, and so on. A pipeline contains from 1 to n
models.

end
```

### Models
A model is an AI model that is a part of a pipeline. A model accepts images as
input and returns JSON as output. Generally, this JSON contains the coordinates
of objects in the source image, that the model may pass along to feed the next
step of the pipeline.


### Model from Frontend
On the frontend interface, a pipeline will be called a model, because the user
will not be aware of the difference. From the user's perspective, they send data
to a model and receive the result.

*Suggestion: we could call the pipeline a method if we don't want to mix terms.*

### Inference Request function
The inference request function plays a crucial role in Nachet Interactive's backend.
It requests actions from selected models or pipelines based on certain checks.
These checks include verifying that all arguments required to find or initialize 
the blob container and process the image have been transmitted to the function.
It also checks if the selected pipeline is recognized by the system and if the image sent for analysis
has a valid header.

If all the above checks pass, the function initializes or finds the user blob container
and uploads the image. Next, it requests an inference from every model in the pipeline.
Each model specifies their `entry_function` (how to call and retrieve data) and whether
they have a `process_inference` function. Based on these indications, the results are returned
and stored in the cache.

If no other model is called, the last result is then processed and sent to the frontend.

### Input and Output for inference request
The inference request will process the following parameters:

|Key parameters | Expected Value|
--|--
model_name | The name of the pipeline
folder_name | The folder where the image is uploaded in the user's container
container_name | The user's container
imageDims | The dimension of the image
image | The image encoded in b64 (ASCII)

Note that since the information is received from the frontend, the model_name is
an abstraction for a pipeline.

The inference request will return a list with the following information:
|key parameters | hierarchy Levels | Return Value |
|--|--|--|
|Filename| 0 | Contains the filename of the image|
|Boxes | 0 | Contains all the boxes returned by the inference request|
|labelOccurence | 0 | Contains the number of label occurence|
|totalBoxes | 0 | Boxes total number|
|Box | 1 | Contains all the information of one seed in the image|
|label | 1 | Contains the top label for the seed|
|score | 1 | Contains the top score for the seed|
|topN | 1 | Contains the top N scores for the seed|
|overlapping | 1 | Contains a boolean to tell if the box overlap with another one|
|overlappingIndices | 1 | Contains the index of the overlapping box|
|topX | 2 | The top x value of the box around a seed|
|topY | 2 | The top y value of the box around a seed|
|bottomX | 2 | The bottom x value of the box around a seed|
|bottomY| 2 | The bottom y value of the box around a seed|

*for more look at [nachet-model-documentation](https://github.com/ai-cfia/nachet-backend/blob/51-implementing-2-models/docs/nachet-model-documentation.md#return-value-of-models)*

**topN** contains the top 5 predictions of the models:
```json
"topN": [
    {
        "label": "seed_name",
        "score": 0.75
    }
    {
        "label": "seed_name",
        "score": 0.18
    }
    {
        "label": "seed_name",
        "score": 0.05
    }
    {
        "label": "seed_name",
        "score": 0.019
    }
    {
        "label": "seed_name",
        "score": 0.001
    }
]
```

### Blob storage and Pipeline versioning
To keep track of the various pipelines iterations and versions, JSON files are 
stored in the blob storage. Users can add the JSON to the blob storage 
using the `pipelines_version_insertion.py` script. This allows for easy 
management of model and pipeline history.

To use the script, 3 environment variables are necessary:
* NACHET_BLOB_PIPELINE_NAME
  * Containing the blob name where the pipelines are stored
* NACHET_BLOB_PIPELINE_VERSION
  * Containing the version the user wants to select
* NACHET_BLOB_PIPELINE_DECRYPTION_KEY
  * The key to decrypt sensible data such as the API key and the endpoint of a model.

#### In the code
In the backend, the pipelines are retrieved using the `get_pipelines` function.
This function retrieved the data from the blob storage and stored the pipeline in
the `CACHE["endpoint"]` variable. This the variable that feed the frontend the `models`
information and metadata.

```python
async def get_pipeline(mock:bool = False):
    """
    Retrieves the pipelines from the Azure storage API.

    Parameters:
    - mock (bool): If True, retrieves the pipelines from a mock JSON file. If False, retrieves the pipelines from the Azure storage API.

    Returns:
    - list: A list of dictionaries representing the pipelines.
    """
    if mock:
        with open("mock_pipeline_json.json", "r+") as f:
            result_json = json.load(f)
    else:
        result_json = await azure_storage_api.get_pipeline_info(connection_string, PIPELINE_BLOB_NAME, PIPELINE_VERSION)
        cipher_suite = Fernet(FERNET_KEY)
    # Get all the api_call function and map them in a dictionary
    api_call_function = {func.split("from_")[1]: getattr(model_module, func) for func in dir(model_module) if "inference" in func.split("_")}
    # Get all the inference functions and map them in a dictionary 
    inference_functions = {func: getattr(inference, func) for func in dir(inference) if "process" in func.split("_")}

    models = ()
    for model in result_json.get("models"):
        m = Model(
            api_call_function.get(model.get("api_call_function")),
            model.get("model_name"),
            cipher_suite.decrypt(model.get("endpoint").encode()).decode(),
            cipher_suite.decrypt(model.get("api_key").encode()).decode(),
            inference_functions.get(model.get("inference_function")),
            model.get("content-type"),
            model.get("deployment_platform")
        )
        models += (m,)
    
    # Build the pipeline to call the models in order in the inference request
    for pipeline in result_json.get("pipelines"):
        CACHE["pipelines"][pipeline.get("pipeline_name")] = tuple([m for m in models if m.name in pipeline.get("models")])

    return result_json.get("pipelines") 

```
